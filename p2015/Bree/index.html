    <P><h1 style="color:green">My spring break has been mostly boring.I never do anything on break, other than eat and sleep. The only exciting things so far were Easter and this computer programming club that I am typing from right now.I only have English homework, so I have time for stuff. I'm really excited to get some time off.</P> 
    <P><h1 style="color:blue">Easter (aka yesterday) was pretty fun. My sister and I found a lot of eggs (even though the hiding spots were SUPER GOOD this year). Some even had money in them! I'm $15 richer now, mostly thanks to my golden egg, which contained $10.I also have a basket full of LOTS OF CANDY!! I'm going to be in candy paradise!! After the Easter egg hunt, we went to my aunt's house. We had a grill there, which was great because my uncle is AMAZING on the grill. Overall,it was a pretty fun day!</P>
