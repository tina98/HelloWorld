		<p> We went to someone's house to play. We were there from 4:00 to 7:00. We played
		Scavenger Hunt, which soon turned into a tackling game because we had to race
		eachother. Rishab hid 6 stuffed animals, and we had to find them. But then there was
		a 3-way tie.</p>
		<p style="color: FF007F"> The animals that he hid were: </p> 
		<ul style="color: FF007F">
			<li> a bear </li> 
			<li> another bear </li> 
			<li> another bear </li> 
			<li> a doll </li> 
			<li> a red angry bird </li> 
			<li> a yellow angry bird </li> 
		</ul>
		<P> Then, Rishab said that to break the tie, we had to find the yellow angry bird,
		run upstairs with it, touch the couch, and run back down to the basement.
