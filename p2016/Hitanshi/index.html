what have I learned so far from Hello World?
</h1>

I'm here at the hello world program. This program lasts all through spring break and it's a girls only program teaching girls that they can learn conputer science too, not only boys. It is the first day and i've already learned sooooo much. So far we have gone onto a sight called scratch.com. on this sight you can program anything you want however you want. We also learned how to make a websight and what certain symbols mean.
