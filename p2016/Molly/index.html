<p>What have you learned so far from Hello World?</p>
</h1>
<p><h5>
I have learned a lot about the program Scratch and its many possibilities for the vast creative mind. When I went to Microsoft I got to program a BrainPad
in which I got to control the lights and sounds of the pad. Also I got to program a bird-like robot called Finch and I coded it to change beak colors and move
around with light sensors and the up,down,left,and right key,and space bar.</h5>

<h1>
What do I think of Hello World?
</h1>
<p><h5>I think that Hello World is a great program for girls that are interested in computer science.Also it really teaches you about 
the vast possibilities for game design and website making.</h5>

What questions do you have about women in computing?
</h1>
<h5>
  <ul>
     <li>Does more men than women in your field ever discourage you?</li>
     <li>What inspired you to do what you do today?</li>
     <li>What would be your best tip for young girls to be motivated to be in computer science even when times get rough?</li>
